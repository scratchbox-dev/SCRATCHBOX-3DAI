# System Architecture Suggestions - April 1

## 1. Enhanced Entity Component System

The current `EntityBase` class (938 lines) could benefit from being broken down into a more formal Entity-Component-System architecture: 
EntityBase (extend from TransformNode, container)
├── GenerativeEntity 
    ├── gizmoMesh(2d plane for 2d generation), 
    ├── modelMesh (3d mesh converted from the 2d generation)
    ├── generationLogs (array of GenerationLog)
    └── processingState (should not be serialized)
├── ShapeEntity (hold a shape type, and a child mesh)
├── LightEntity (hold a light type, a gizmoMesh, a light, and properties(color, intensity))
└── etc.

**Benefits:**
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More scalable as you add new entity types

## 2. Separation of Core Logic from Serialization

Currently, the entity class mixes core functionality with serialization logic. Consider separating these into:
- Core entity functionality
- Dedicated serialization/deserialization modules

## 3. Improved Scene Management

Scene management is spread across various files. Consider creating a dedicated `SceneManager` class that would centralize:
- Scene initialization
- Environment management
- Entity management
- Scene serialization/deserialization

## 4. Modular AI Generation System

The AI generation logic could be more modular and extensible through:
- Abstract base classes for generation services
- Concrete implementations for different generation types
- Factory pattern to get the appropriate service

## 5. Enhanced Command Pattern Implementation

The command pattern implementation could be expanded to include:
- Command grouping for complex operations
- Command queuing for operations that should run sequentially
- Conditional commands

## 6. State Management Optimization

Consider organizing React contexts into more specific providers:
- Main editor context for core editor state
- Entity-specific context
- Generation-specific context
- Rendering-specific context

## 7. Event System

Implementing a dedicated event system would decouple components and make communication cleaner:
- Central event bus for application-wide communication
- Subscription/publishing mechanism
- Event-driven architecture for better component isolation

## 8. Documentation Strategy

A more comprehensive documentation approach would benefit the project:
- JSDoc comments for all public methods and classes
- Architecture diagrams showing component relationships
- Entity lifecycle documentation from creation to serialization
